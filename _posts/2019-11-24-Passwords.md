# Passwords

As you might have noticed over the years, companies have been forcing you to modify your passwords to make it harder for  you to remember.  Nowadays, their mandates usually include:

•	Minimum of 8 characters
•	Combination of upper and lower case
•	At least 1 symbol or number.

They did not do this to make your life harder; it’s all about security.  The bad guys can hack easy passwords in minutes using a variety of techniques.  One way of making your password harder to crack is to inject numbers or symbols instead of letters.  For example look at the following progression.

-	password
-	Password
-	Passw0rd
-	P@ssw0rd
-	P@55w0rd

While you can still read the last example, it is harder for the bad guys to crack.  Its not as hard as &6Q$#0M! to crack, but it is easier to remember.

Many in the cyber community are now recommending passphrases of at least 14 characters.
